A movie platform can be developed using React.js, Redux Toolkit, Gemini, and TMDB API. This platform would allow users to categorize movies by genre, view trailers, see cast/director information, and receive AI-driven movie suggestions based on their preferences.
1. High-Level Architecture
Frontend: React.js for the UI, Vite for fast builds.
State Management: Redux Toolkit to manage global states such as user preferences, movie lists, and chat history.
Data Source: TMDB API for all movie, trailer, and person (cast/director) data.
AI Engine: Google Gemini API for natural language recommendations. 
2. Core Feature Implementation
Categorization by Genre: Fetch genres from TMDB's genre/movie/list endpoint and use them to filter movie cards.
Trailers & Visuals: Access movie trailers via the movie/{id}/videos endpoint. Use React Player to embed YouTube links directly in the UI.
Cast & Director Information: Use movie/{id}/credits to get names and IDs. Clicking a person should trigger a search via person/{id}/combined_credits to show all their previous movies and web series.
AI Chat Search:
The Workflow: A user sends a prompt (e.g., "Show me psychological thrillers like Inception").
Gemini Integration: Use the @google/generative-ai SDK. Prompt Gemini to return a structured list of movie titles or TMDB IDs based on the user's intent.
Result Rendering: Pass those IDs back into the TMDB API to fetch high-quality posters and metadata for React components. 
3. Project Structure Recommendation
Component/Folder 	Responsibility
src/store/	Redux slices for movieSlice (fetching data) and chatSlice (AI interactions).
src/services/	API wrappers for both tmdb.js (Axios) and gemini.js.
src/components/	Reusable UI like MovieCard, TrailerModal, and ChatWindow.
src/pages/	Home, GenrePage, PersonDetail, and SearchHistory.
4. Demonstrating Job Readiness
AI Integration: Shows the ability to bridge raw LLM capabilities with traditional REST APIs.
Complex State: Demonstrates mastery of Redux Toolkit for non-trivial state synchronization (e.g., updating UI based on AI chat results).
Performance: Using Debouncing for search and lazy-loading images shows attention to detail. 
Getting Started:
Get a TMDB API key from TMDB Settings.
Get a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
Store these in a .env file to keep them secure. 

my AI works like that I search in search bar using AI, tell like a retro romantic movie, then based on this it shows me movies and webseries according that
